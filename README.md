# Java Script Data Structures

## Purpose

I've decided to invest some time studying Data Structures and Algorithms and to really understand the underlaying of how some Data Structures works... I've decided to implement them in Javascript ( given that this is the language that I've been using at work ).

This repository will serve as reference for my self but maybe it helps someone else.

## How it's organized

I'll organize the structure like this:

- root
  - [DataStructure-1]
    - Implementation
      - [DataStructure-1].js
    - Usage
      - [SomeAlgorithmSolving].js
  - [DataStructure-2]
    - Implementation
      - [DataStructure-2].js
    - Usage
      - [SomeAlgorithmSolving].js
